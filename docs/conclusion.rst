Conclusion
==========

This project was made to learn how to use python, and even it was already the case for me, I still have learned lot of things, especially conserning scientific libraries like numpy. It's also the first time I need to parrallellize a code and I was really surprising of the simplicity to implement that.

The physics part was also interesting, it learn me that the ionisation energy depend on the shape and the number of atoms in the materials... at least at a small level, because it's cosntant when the number of atom is huge (wich is always the case in a maccroscopic world)

At the begining, I was expecting to have very differents results depending of the simulation parameters (especially depending of the grain shape) but it it is actually verry difficult to determine a significative difference between all histograms. I'm really wondering if my grain shapes are correct or not...
Maybe more photons can lead to a more precise histogram and then make appear some difference, but after having made lot of simulations with milliosn of photons, I was also thinking to preserve my processor that is not made to run at 100% for a long time (especially because my air cooling system is not enough in these conditions)
