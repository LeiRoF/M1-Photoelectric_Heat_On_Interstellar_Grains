During this project, I made a lot of simulation with diffrenet kinds of grain, different angles and differents energies. You can see beloaw some exemple of results.

I was trying here to compare how the grain shape imapact the distribution of the final electron energie. On the following picture, each window correspond to a grain. Windows on the left correspond to grains with ``beta = 0.5`` and it goes to ``2.0`` in the windows on the right (with a step of ``0.5``). Every windows on the same row share the same ``sigma_dens`` parameter, set to ``0.5`` at the bottom and ``1`` at the top.

In short, the more you look at a windows at the bottom right, the more the considered grain is shattered.

All these simulation were made with the following set of parameters:

- Grain size = 100
- Random photon angle
- Random target
- 100 000 photons
